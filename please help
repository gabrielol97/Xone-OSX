hey! I',m having a huge problem with your software and couldn't find a repositiory to tell you about it. anyway when I plug in my xbox one controller, it is lighting up but it isn't being recognzied by my macbook. I cannot change the plug on my controller, should I just throw it away bc it will not be recognized ever?
